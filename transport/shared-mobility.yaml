title: Shared mobility
description: |-
  Penetration of services that explore the shared use of resources (e.g.
  vehicles) or services (e.g. ride) to increase the efficiency of mobility
  provision. This increase in efficiency can be dual: in reducing the holding
  of stock resources of mobility underused (e.g. cars) or in improving the
  efficiency of the resources when travelling (e.g. share rides and increase
  load factors). The concept explores the spectrum between private and public
  transport in terms of service provision and environmental and operational
  efficiency.

  This file describes data that can quantify this phenomenon. Not all of the
  quantities will be needed in a given application.
