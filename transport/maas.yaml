title: Shared mobility
description: |-
  Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an emerging concept that builds on a single,
  digital, customer interface to source and manage travel-related services. At
  its core, the concept of MaaS supports the digital joining-up of different
  transport, information and payment services into a smooth and reliable
  customer experience. These services may be those provided by a single
  operator in cases where extensive vertical integration of services exist or
  may involve a MaaS provider bringing together services offered by third
  parties into a coherent framework. MaaS supports the integration of public
  transport modes, commercial transport services such as ride-sourcing, bike
  and car sharing and taxis into a comprehensive mobility offer. Whole journey
  (point-to-point) planning, and, depending on the level of integration, the
  purchasing of tickets and booking of demand-responsive / shared / taxi modes
  would be completed via this data integration platform. In its most ambitious
  forms, the delivery of Mobility as a Service would require the integration of
  ticketing and payment systems across modes and potentially providers.

  This file describes data that can quantify this phenomenon. Not all of the
  quantities will be needed in a given application.
