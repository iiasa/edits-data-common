title: Compact/transit-oriented urbanization
description: |-
  Urbanization, dense urban form, and/or public/active transport provision could
  lead to more active/public transport versus private, motorized transport.

  Includes planning, transport-oriented development measuers, etc. that alter
  land-use patterns.

  This file describes data that can quantify this phenomenon. Not all of the
  quantities will be needed in a given application.

      Distinguishing at least (a) active, (b) public, and (c) other transport;
      in some cases separating:

      - Active: walk, bicycle/scooter, etc.
      - Public: bus, light rail, heavy rail, etc.

measure:
  access-1:
    description: |-
      Number of jobs accessible within X travel time (e.g. 30 minutes).
  access-2:
    description: |-
      Fraction of population within X distance (e.g. 500 metres) of a public
      transport stop, or other analogous measures.
  activity:
    description: |-
      Amount of travel by a person or group of persons.
  connectivity:
    description: |-
      Dimensionless indices of complexity/connectivity. Condition experienced by
      the average/median person or measure for an entire city.
  population:
    description: Count of people in a given area.
  route-length:
    description: |-
      Total size of infrastructure for a given mode of transport, inclusive of
      length of metro, tram, or bus routes; active transport routes; roads for
      private vehicles.
  stations:
    description: |-
      Count of stations or stops for a given (usually public transit) mode

quantity:
- measure: activity
  dimensions: [time, space, mode]
  description: |-
    Could be expressed as a total (count of trips; distance, time, or
    expenditure) or some statistic across these, e.g. mean, median, or quantile.

- measure: population
  dimensions: [time, city]
  description: |-
    a.k.a. “city size”. Relevant because a city of e.g. 30 million has a
    different potential for active mobility than a city of 3 million.
