# Information about the data
title: IEA Mobility Model (MoMo)
description: >
  The IEA MoMo is the main tool used for the definition of transport scenarios
  in the IEA. In particular, the IEA MoMo database feeds into the Word Energy
  Model.
# Information about the data provider
provider:
  organisation: International Energy Agency (IEA)
  contact: jacob.teter@iea.org

# Arbitrary hierarchical classifiers describing the data
classifiers:
- "Kind :: Model output"
- "Availability :: Collaborators only"

key outputs:
  1: >-
    National-level vehicle sales / stocks, by vehicle category (2/3-wheelers,
    small-medium and large cars, light commercial vehicles, medium- and heavy-duty trucks,
    minibuses, buses, metros, light-rail, conventional and high-speed trains,
    ships [5 categores], aircraft [9 size classes]), and by powertrain [ICE/HEV/PHEV gasoline /diesel, BEV, FCEV for road modes, all major potential
    powertrains for rail, ships, aircraft].
  2: National level vkm/pkm/tkm on each of the above-listed vehicle categories /
    powertrains.
  3: Final energy consumption by all the above-listed vehicle categories /
    powertrains.
  4: Direct CO2 emissions / WTW GHG emissions by above-listed vehicle
    categories / powertrains.
  5: Capital / O&M / fuel costs by above-listed vehicle categories / powertrains.
  6: Infrastructure deployment required by above-listed vehicle categories /
    powertrains.
  7: Capital / O&M / reconstruction / renovation costs of infrastructure deployed
    for above-listed vehicle categories / powertrains.

demand-side representation:
  - Fundamental drivers are GDP and population projections from IMF /
    UN.
  - GIS analysis of population density (under SSPs) further modulate
    patterns of passenger transport activity (e.g. by bounding potential
    to shift to non-motorised / metro / light-rail / BRT / bus).
  - Fiscal / regulatory / city-level development policies (including investments in public
    transport infrastructure / farebox subsidies) further modulate modal shift
    potential.
  - Fuel / energy-vector prices are taken from supply module (TIMES/Markal).
  - Shipping projections soft-linked to ITF gravity-based modelling, which in turn is
    informed by OECD economic projections.
  - Aviation modelling relies on University College London's Aviation Integrated Model (AIM).
  - Road, rail, and maritime freight includes top-down estimates of potential for operational /
    logistics efficiency (with literature-based estimates, measure by measure, under simple
    non-additive assumptions of impacts).

        Colombia, and Israel).
      subnational: >
        Three city size classes (grouped by potential for metro/light-rail,
        BRT, and bus networks, respectively), plus urban/rural resolution.

    # Description is optional for time/space, but required otherwise.
    # We might settle on common definitions in the future, but for now
    # each group can describe what specifically they mean by each concept

    - GHG emissions: >
        Currently updating benchmarking for WTW GHG emissions by
        fuel / energy vector supply chain.
    # Air pollution
    - non-GHG emissions: >
        Estimates based on emission factors (e.g. from COPERT / ICCT). Need to
        move to annual resolution with better specified scrappage / mileage
        functions, plus better benchmarking data, to have more confidence in
        these estimates.

# Top-down vs bottom-up
approach:
  hybrid: >
    Stock-accounting and comparative costs of ownership / operation very
    bottom-up for a global model with such coverage, but projection methodologies
    quite top-down (e.g. based on GDP, population, population density, etc.).

# stand-alone or linked with other(s)
linkage:
  description: >
    MoMo is used to critically assess the assumptions / methods / results of
    the IEA World Energy Model (used by the WEO division).
  - stand-alone model linked with others: >
      In the modelling framework of the IEA, MoMo is linked to the other modelling
      platforms of the Energy Technology and Policy Division.
  - It is a module of a larger or different model (e.g. Integrated Assessment Model)
